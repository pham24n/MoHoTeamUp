    <h2>How to come up with an idea for your project?</h2>
    <p>
      Remember what your goal is, especially when you are doing this for the first time, trying to learn new skills in a specific language? applying CS knowledge to your own fun idea? Whatever it is, here are a few things to help you navigate:
<ul>
  <li>Are you having <b>fun</b>? What is something you are excited about, what is something you care about? </li>
  <li>Is the project providing you with <b>value</b>? </li>
  <li> <b>Start simple </b> — You know your own limit. It’s okay to feel a little ambitious and try cool complex projects to make a shiny portfolio, but be careful not to overwhelm yourself with new technologies and frameworks then give up midway.  </li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>... and many others you can find at Addtional Resources below!

      Plan plan plan: 
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li> What is the goal of this project? How long are you planning to work on it? </li>
        <li> What do you want your product to look like, what features it will include? </li>
        <li> What technology are you going to use? </li>
      </ul>
    <p> &rarr; Make a <b>task list </b>, <b> set deadlines </b>,  draft a <b> sketch </b> of your product. </p>
    <p> 
      Once you feel prepared, code away
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li> If you are already familiar with the technology, plan an implementation strategy (see below for more guidance)</li>
        <li> If you are learning new technology, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me?u=35668980"> LinkedIn Learning</a> and tutorial blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> or <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-i-made-my-own-library-of-hd-gifs-57773wxg">Hackernoon</a> often offer straightforward explanation to help you along the way</li>
