    <h2>How to come up with an idea for your project?</h2>
    <p>
      Coming up with ideas aren't usually as hard as we think it is. In fact, ideas are all around you, just waiting for you to jump upon it. As such,
      try reflect on your daily life and see if there is anything you can do to help yourself and others is a great way to start!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is there a problem that you or your friends are having trouble with?</li>
        <li>Is there a technical tool that you wish you could have?</li>
        <li>Is there a different way of doing things that you would prefer?</li>
      </ul>
    <p>No need to worry about whether the idea is realistic or not at this time.
      Just unleash your creativity and see where it leads you.</p>

    <p>Your project doesn't have to be all about solving problems. It could be a chance for you to have fun and explore your interests.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you have a hobby?</li>
          <li>Is there anything that you are particularly interested in?</li>
        </ul>
    <p>It's ok if you don't. Try reflect on what excites you and ask yourself lots of questions as you navigate through life.
      You may be interested in a lot more things than you know!</p>
      <p>Social media can be a good place to start.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What caught your attention when you were on social media today?</li>
          <li>What Facebook groups/pages do you follow?</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Besides, the internet is a resourceful source that you should go to.
      <a href = " https://github.com/trending">GitHub</a> and <a href= "https://devpost.com/software">Devpost</a> are great places to look for inspirations!</li>
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      Remember what your goal is, especially when you are doing this for the first time, trying to learn new skills in a specific language? applying CS knowledge to your own fun idea? Whatever it is, here are a few things to help you navigate:
<ul>
  <li>Are you having <b>fun</b>? What is something you are excited about, what is something you care about? </li>
  <li>Is the project providing you with <b>value</b>? </li>
  <li> <b>Start simple </b> — You know your own limit. It’s okay to feel a little ambitious and try cool complex projects to make a shiny portfolio, but be careful not to overwhelm yourself with new technologies and frameworks then give up midway.  </li>
</ul>
</p>
