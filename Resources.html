    <h2>How to come up with an idea for your project?</h2>
    <p>
      Coming up with ideas aren't usually as hard as we think it is. In fact, ideas are all around you, just waiting for you to jump upon it. As such,
      try reflect on your daily life and see if there is anything you can do to help yourself and others is a great way to start!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is there a problem that you or your friends are having trouble with?</li>
        <li>Is there a technical tool that you wish you could have?</li>
        <li>Is there a different way of doing things that you would prefer?</li>
      </ul>
    <p>No need to worry about whether the idea is realistic or not at this time.
      Just unleash your creativity and see where it leads you.</p>

    <p>Your project doesn't have to be all about solving problems. It could be a chance for you to have fun and explore your interests.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you have a hobby?</li>
          <li>Is there anything that you are particularly interested in?</li>
        </ul>
    <p>It's ok if you don't. Try reflect on what excites you and ask yourself lots of questions as you navigate through daily life.
      You may be interested in a lot more things than you know!</p>
      <p>Social media can be a good place to start.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What caught your attention when you were on social media today?</li>
          <li>What Facebook groups/pages do you follow?</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Besides, the internet is a wonderful source that you should go to.
      <a href = " https://github.com/trending">GitHub</a> and <a href= "https://devpost.com/software">Devpost</a> are great places to look for inspirations!</li>

    <h2>How to get started once you have an idea?</h2>
    <p>
      Plan plan plan:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li> What is the goal of this project? How long are you planning to work on it? </li>
        <li> What do you want your product to look like, what features it will include? </li>
        <li> What technology are you going to use? </li>
      </ul>
    <p> &rarr; Make a <b>task list </b>, <b> set deadlines </b>,  draft a <b> sketch </b> of your product. </p>
    <p>

    </p>
      <ul>
        <li> If you are already familiar with the technology, plan an implementation strategy (see below for more guidance)</li>
        <li> If you are learning new technology, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me?u=35668980"> LinkedIn Learning</a> and tutorial blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> or <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-i-made-my-own-library-of-hd-gifs-57773wxg">Hackernoon</a> often offer straightforward explanation to help you along the way</li>
        <li> If you are collaborating with other people, you might want to get familiar with some version control tools to help you keep track of changes or fixes in your code as you go.<a href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github"> Here </a> is a good tutorial on GitHub </li>

    <h2>What to do next?</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
