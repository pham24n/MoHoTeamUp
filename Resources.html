    <h2>How to come up with an idea for your project?</h2>
    <p>
      So you decided to work on some side projects. There are millions of ideas out there in the resources you've found. 
      You keep reading and scrolling and somehow are inundated with these shiny overachieving ideas, or some that are just kinda… boring? 
      It’s okay if yours have been done before. But remember what your goal is, especially when you are doing this for the first time, trying to learn new skills in a specific language? apply CS knowledge to your own fun idea? These are a few things to help you navigate:
<ul>
  <li>Are you having <b>fun</b>? </li>
  <li>Is the project providing you with <b>value</b>? Are you learning new skills? Are you gaining new information?</li>
  <li> <b>Start simple </b> — You know your own limit. It’s okay to feel a little ambitious and try cool complex projects to make a shiny portfolio, but be careful not to overwhelm yourself with new technologies and frameworks then give up midway.  </li>
  <li> Not/Starting from scratch — Often, you may not be satisfied with what you found online. So starting from scratch is totally fine as long as you have the plan and the energy to go on with it. However, <b>not starting from scratch means time saved </b>. If you found a project you think can be improved or adjusted to better fit you and your community, go for it!
  </li>
</ul>

        <li> What is the goal of this project? How long are you plan to work on it? What do you want your product to look like? Make a <b>task list </b>, <b> set deadlines </b>,  draft a <b> sketch </b> of your product. </li>
        <li> Also you might want familiarize yourself with some version control tools to help you keep track of changes or fixes in your code as you go. </li>
